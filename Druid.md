**Druid Challenge 1**

![Silent Assassins](/realm/img/picks/SilentAssistanceChallenges.png "Silent Assistance") **Silent Assistance**

The ancient druids request evidence that you are a servant of balance before your inclusion to their ranks.

**Requirements**: 4 Reincarnations, Halls of Balance spell upgrade, Elf 1 and Demon 1 challenges completed

**Challenge**: Make the building targeted by Grand Balance surpass 99.9% of your production.

**Effect**: Animal Companions (1,2) works faster

**New Formula**: floor((sqrt(1 + 16 * x) - 1) / 2), where x is your Playtime (This Game) stat in hours.

**Upgrade**: Good for Druid

**Tips**:

Make sure your least-producing building still makes up a large proportion of your production (2% and up). This will necessarily balance the production of each of your other buildings around 9.09% (= 1/11). Upgrade buildings only as required to balance them. Building more Farms, Inns and Blacksmiths will increase the multiplier of the final cast of Grand Balance.

**Requirements**: 25 Reincarnations, Druid Unique Building

**Challenge**: Cast 13 Grand Balances in the first 5 minutes of a playthrough with 0 non-Druid researches.

**Effect**: All spell durations increased by 1% for every 1,500 max mana.

**Tips**

Do not buy Halls of Balance as it increases the spell duration. Make sure you have some excavations to buy the Heritages. (Angel Heritage and Angel 1 challenge both boost your m/s.) To acheive this, you need a min. of 50 m/s with Grand Balance continuously casting during 13 full casts. Reward given at 5 minute mark regardless of when achieved.
